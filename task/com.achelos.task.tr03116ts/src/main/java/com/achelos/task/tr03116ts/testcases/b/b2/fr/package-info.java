/**
 * Test cases from TR-03116-TS #6.3.2.2 Module B2_FR - Further Requirements.
 * <p>
 * These tests validate support of additional requirements resulting from [TR-03116].
 * <p>
 * The DUT acts as the TLS server and the system of the test operator as the TLS client. For each test, the operator has
 * to connect to the server and evaluate the result. This module tests the behaviour in case client authentication is
 * used.
